## The book is "Introduction to Programming with C++" Second Edition by Y. Daniel Liang

This will act mainly as repository for myself as reference for Chapter Examples and Work Problems dealing with various
concepts. Any and all problems are from the text book, they are not mine, if you use them please reference the above
textbook.
